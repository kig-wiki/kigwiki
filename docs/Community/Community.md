This section is currently under development. If you have ideas for content, please reach out to us
on the github repo.

What this section will _not_ cover is advertising communities nor trying to make this resource into
a community either. This is a resource for the community, not a community itself.

Kigurumi draws fans from all background, and open spaces such as social media or groupchats can draw especially colorful personalities. However, they do not represent every kigurumi nor kigurumi fan. If youâ€™re ne try not to let an off encounter shape your view. The broader community is wide-ranging, welcoming, and rich with unique approaches to the hobby.
