Kigurumi is a unique form of masked cosplay blending the real world with stylization of fiction. The primary component is titular kigurumi mask itself, a mascot-like mask that covers the face and head typically in an anime style.

Kigurumi performers often pair the kigurumi mask with a [hadatai skinsuit](/docs/hadatai/), a skin-tight, flesh-toned bodysuit that covers everything the mask doesn't. Combined they result in a mascot-like appearance often with the goal of representing a fictional character and the nuance of their design closer than any human in the flesh quite can. Kigurumi generally is a costumed hobby, not just about the mask.

The Japanese term Kigurumi (着ぐるみ) itself is somewhat of a blanketed term for full body costumes, The anime kigurumi masks this wiki is focused on can be specifically referred to as Bishoujo Kigurumi (美少女着ぐるみ), although most kigurumi masks are not limited to just anime characters nor only girl characters.

Kigurumi Pajamas is the term most frequently confused in the west with kigurumi masks. Pajamas are comfy however not the target of this wiki.
