question: "What exactly is Animegao?",
answer: "Animegao is an old translation artifact dating back to early web translations of the term Kigurumi. Specifically, anime-style masks were confused to be a unique term for Kigurumi masks themselves. This is not the case; however, in the west, it has become its own sub-genre of Kigurumi, embracing stylizations unique to western mask makers."
