# Contributing

## Contributing Guidelines

tldr: Be nice, be respectful, be helpful. Don't try to upload content you don't have permission to share with us, or content that goes against GitHub's terms of service. We're not here to police things nor make overall decisions about content, but will remove content that is inappropriate and risks impacting the site.

## How to Contribute

Contributing to this documentation is _fairly_ straightforward! Here's how you can help:

### Quick Method (GitHub Web UI)

1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes directly in GitHub's web interface
3. Submit a Pull Request from your fork to our `staging-build` branch

Since we're primarily dealing with Markdown files, the GitHub web interface is perfect for most contributions!

### Traditional Method

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch for your changes
4. Make your changes
5. Consider using the docker compose file to test the site locally
6. Push to your fork
7. Submit a Pull Request to our `staging-build` branch. It builds a preview available at [staging.kig.wiki](https://staging.kig.wiki)

### Document Structure

- All documentation pages go in the `docs/` directory
- Images should be placed in `public/img/`
- To reference images in your markdown:

  ```markdown
  ![Image Description](/img/your-image.png)
  ```

- Docusaurus supports [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for more advanced content.

### Need Help?

If you're not familiar with Git or GitHub, don't worry! You can:

1. Open an issue describing the changes you'd like to make
2. Reach out to the maintainers for guidance
3. Share your content, and we can help get it added

While we can't guarantee all submissions will be published, we appreciate all contributions that align with our guidelines.

Want your own staging site? Raise an issue and we can probably get you one!
