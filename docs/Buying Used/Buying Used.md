A used kigurumi mask can be one of the most accessible ways to owning your own kig mask. Sometimes a kig just doesnt wear one of their masks so often, dont have the connection to a particular character anymore, or are just looking to clear space for future masks. These can present a rather quick and affordable way to get your hands on a kigurumi mask if things look right.

The usual places to find used kigurumi masks tend to depend on region. In Japan yahoo auctions is most common, in China various marketplaces such as Xianyu, and in the west various social media platforms tend to get used such as Blue Sky, Discord and Twitter (Presently X the Everything App).

Things to consider when buying a used kigurumi mask:

- **Head Size**: Is the mask's sizing even appropriate for your head? Just because a mask 'can' fit your head doesn't mean it's a good fit.
- **Wear**: Are there any scuffs, marks, cracks, or chips in the paint? Is the wig in decent condition, or might it need a bit of a restyling?
- **Maker and Materials**: Is the mask made by a reputable maker? If its a maker that uses multiple material such as FRP or PLA, are they ones you will be happy with?

As with any second hand purchase, there are some risks and red flags to be aware of unique to kigurumi masks.

- **Deceptive Photos**: Some sellers will use old photos of the mask or even just the original maker's photos. A proper seller should be able to provide a current photo of the mask in question.
- **Fake Listings**: Some scammers will use fake listings to get people to buy a mask they dont actually have. Mask maker's photos or re-used social media photos are one of the most common red flags. If you can find the owner of the mask on social media, see if its really them selling the mask.
- **Damage in Shipping**: Kigurumi masks can be delicate and damaged in shipping if not packaged properly. If using a proxy service for international buys ensure what their handling is like and if they can safely handle kigurumi masks. Asking kigs you trust for their experience with a proxy service is always a good idea before you trust one with a mask.
- **"Minor Damage"**: Be aware some 'minor damage' isnt always so minor and can be a huge undertaking to fix if its a problem with the mask or paint itself. If you are considering a mask that needs a bit of a touch up, ask the seller if they can provide photos of the damage.
