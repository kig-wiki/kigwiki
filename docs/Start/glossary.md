### **Handler**
- **Definition**: Term for a person who helps a kigurumi get around safely such as at cons, events, or other public places. Often speaks on behalf of the kigurumi.

## K

### **Kig fan**
- **Definition**: A term often used in a slightly demeaning manner to describe someone who is a bit *too* into kigurumi but without actually being a kigurumi performer themselves, a kig "chaser" of sorts. More specifically someone that compulsively lurks in kigurumi communities and may be annoying.
- **Context**: Most who enjoy kigurumi are not "kig fans", but every "kig fan" is a fan of kigurumi.

### **Kigurumi** (着ぐるみ)

## Internationally confusing terms best avoided

Ideally this section would not exist, however, some confusing terms get used that should be addressed as unpleasent as they can be. There are international nuances to these terms which can be considered confusing or problematic in various regions.

**Animegao or Animegao Mask**
- **Definition**: Anime face
- **Reasoning**: An old mistranslation artifact from the early days of machine translations, where "anime faced" masks were confused for a unique term. The term is not used internationally, and can be confusing to international audiences as a sort of faux-Japanese term. [The Japanese wikipedia page](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BE%8E%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3%E7%9D%80%E3%81%90%E3%82%8B%E3%81%BF) has long noted that this term is an 'overseas specific term', and is not used in Japan much as some attempt to edit Wikipedia to make the term sound more genuine than it is.
- **Historical Context**: The term was used to astroturf kigurumi masks in the west, as you would find only western results searching for the term. 
- **In defence of**: The term does at least differentiate between referring to masks versus onsie type pajamas. However you can just say kigurumi mask, kig mask, or similar.

**Kiger**
- **Definition**: A shorthand term for a **kig**urumi perform**er** often used in Chinese and sometimes Japanese contexts.
- **Reasonings**: Some westerners use the term ironically in a racist connotation or as a dog whistle. People are not clueless especially when a second g is added in the term, it is not some "secret" term.
Use of the term in western English contexts is not recommended, do not harass or try to "educate" Japanese or Chinese kigurumi performers who use the term, as it is properly understood in their native contexts.
- **Related**: See [Coser](#coser)
- **In defence of**: Origins outside English, so terminology and slang is not the same. It too is a term to differentiate between those who wear kigurumi masks vs those who wear onsie pajamas.
