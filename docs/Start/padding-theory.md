# Padding Theory

Anime style characters rarely have human proportions, this tends to be especially true for bishoujo characters. 

So for kigurumi, shapeewear and padding are often used to complement the mask's size, and one's body shape to create a more true to 2d anime character.

There are a number of ways to achieve various body types, and the exact padding used can vary depending on your own body shape. Padding in kig is not exclusive to any body shape or gender, even women who kig tend to work their proportions to achieve a more anime style look in kig.

## Padding Types

Most padding tends to fall into three types:

- Foam
- Silicone
- Inflatable latex

Common areas for padding itself are generally:

- Hips
- Butt
- Breasts 

Although some may use padding for other areas, these are the most common.

### Foam Padding

The most accessible and flexible to DIY option, foam padding is a classic choice for many kigurumi makers. 
Foam padding can tend to show lines through the hadatai if not smoothed over with shapewear or an extra pair of pantyhose or two. Some prefer to add layers to avoid lines, some embrace the subtle lines padding creates.

Foam while the most breathable of the padding types, its also one of the most annoying to deep clean.  

### Silicone Padding

Less so accessible to make yourself or customize, silicone padding offers neater seam lines, are more flexible and less likely to show through the hadatai.

Beyond costing more, they are also a lot heavier and more of a pain to transport. 

### Inflatable Latex Padding

Inflatable latex padding is the most expensive option, but also the most. Typically in the form of a type of latex shorts, they have inflatable regions to customize their shape to the proportions you desire.


## Shapewear

Shapewear is a type of clothing worn under the hadatai, and usually over padding to smooth out padding lines, refine body curves, and create a more anime style look.

Shapewear is not required, nor is it exclusive to kigurumi by any means. Most kigurumi will use off the shelf shapewear, there aren't exactly kig specific brands.

Various types of shapewear include:

- Waist cinchers
- Full body shapers
- Corsets
- "Butt lifters"
