    question: "Where can I find Kigurumi events?",
    answer: `Kigurumi performers often participate in:

- Anime conventions
- Specialized photoshoots

  {
    question: "Can Kigurumi talk?",
    answer: "Kigurumi masks aren't really made to be talked through, and owing to the mascot-like nature of kigurumi most kigs don't talk to stay in character.\n\nThere are some kigs that do, some might only speak when needed, few kigs deal in absolutes. Some romanticize not talking at all, safety is always most important."
  },
  {
    question: "Can Kigurumi Eat?",
    answer: "Not usually. Remember to stay hydrated and take breaks as needed."
  },
  {
    question: "What exactly is Animegao?",
    answer: "Animegao is an old translation artifact dating back to early web translations of the term Kigurumi. Specifically, anime-style masks were confused to be a unique term for Kigurumi masks themselves. This is not the case; however, in the west it has become its own sub-genre of Kigurumi, embracing stylizations unique to western mask makers."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the appeal of kigurumi?",
    answer: `There are many reasons why people enjoy kigurumi, some of which are:

- Achieving a "2d brought to life" look beyond what cosplay can achieve
  - Being a character they feel simply isn't reasonable for them to cosplay as
- Cosplaying a character without it being tied to their physical looks
  - The anonymous nature of kigurumi, such as an artist, vtuber, etc not wanting to out themselves while cosplaying
- The opportunity to express oneself creatively through the character in a non-verbal way
- Physical comfort of being all-enclosed in the mask and bodysuit`
  },
  {
    question: "Is kigurumi a fetish?",
    answer: `No but yes but no.

Many kigs are people who enjoy the hobby for the sake of being the character or the mascot aspect, many do not engage in NSFW.

However, there are many kigs who are NSFW/fetishists, and it can be difficult to go through kigurumi posts without seeing many such posts on social media. It's akin to how many cosplayers on social media exist who are NSFW, however cosplay itself is not a NSFW activity.

The anonymous nature of kigurumi does however allow for them to engage in creating NSFW content without being recognized, without feeling like they're being judged.`
