# Kigurumi Mask Basics

## Intro to Kigurumi Masks 

The Kigurumi mask itself is the most visible and recognizable component of kigurumi, the focal point of the costume and the character being portrayed.
Typically Kigurumi masks are commisioned from a maker and custom made to the references provided to be as accurate to the character as possible. 

### Materials 
Usually masks are resin 3d printed, or more traditionally made from fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP). Different makers will have different materials and production processes, as well as engineer things in their own ways. 

### Types of Kigurumi Masks

Kigurumi masks usually come as either 'full' face masks that cover the entire head, or mostly-covering 3/4 or 1/2 masks where the hair is the primary part covering the back of the head.

Apart from mask style, there are a few different categories of masks.

#### Generics 

More common to makers using FRP, these masks are based off common molds or 3d models with limited customization options usually limited to the styling of hair or eyes. The size and expressions are typically fixed, resulting in generics of the same model looking like sisters. Typically these masks are used for OC type characters rather than existing characters from various franchises.

[Sigma](https://www.buildupstudiosigma.com/product/ena/) is a good example of a maker with various generics available. Due to the pre-made nature of the shell, they can have shorter production times, although they are not necessarily cheaper than custom masks.

#### Semi-custom

More complex than just generics, these masks are still based off common molds or 3d models, but with more customization options such as customized mouth options, custom accessories, and other details. 

[GKO](https://www.gko-kig.com/mask-onsale) is an example of a maker who has a number of shell types they customize to create various characters. 

#### Custom

More complex than semi-custom, these masks are fully custom made to the commisioner's specifications. Size, expression, eye shape, integrated accessories, and more are all customizable. Most 3d printed masks fall into this category due to the flexability of 3d printing, however some FRP makers will offer custom options.


#### Features

Various makers will have different features and options available. An example of some features makers may offer are:

- Interchangable faceplates
- Removable wigs
- 3d printed hard hair
- Eye options such as "follow-me" eyes or LED lit eyes
- Magnetic accessories such as hats, horns, cat ears, etc
- Glasses
- Piercings

## Kigurumi Mask Visibility

Kigurumi mask visibility varies greatly between makers. All masks will have some level of visibility, however, some makers will have more options than others.

Commonly you can see through a brow crease above the eyes, and some level of visibility through the eyes themselves. 

Sometimes the eyes will have white mesh around the pupil, some makers will have the blacks of the eyes be mesh, sometimes your only downward vision is through slits above the eyes. 

### Prescription Glasses and Contacts

Many masks cannot fit glasses underneath, if contacts are an option, this is a good way to go. If you need to wear glasses, check with the maker if this is a concern about having enough space rather than assume it will.

## Ordering a Kigurumi Mask

For a list of kigurumi mask makers and general information on how to order a kigurumi mask, see our [buying kigurumi masks](../Buy/makers.md) page.

Have patience, many makers have backlogs and it may take some time to get your mask. Sometimes makers may have masks available for immediate purchase, but this is rarely the case and often more when a maker has masks the commisioner has failed to pay the final balance for.

## Kigurumi Mask Padding

Masks come with generic padding that is a best effort from the maker, often however you will want to customize the padding to best fit your head. Many makers will include extra padding for this purpose.

[Mask Padding](../Care/mask-padding.md) has more information on how to pad your mask.


## DIY Kigurumi Masks

DIY Kigurumi masks are do-able, however there is a laundry list of reasons why you may want to commission a mask from a maker instead, especially if you're new to kigurumi masks or DIY prop making. The [cautionary DIY page](../DIY-mask/reality-of-diy.md) has more information on the reality of DIY kigurumi masks.


## Furkigs

Not quite a fursuit, not quite an anime style kigurumi mask, but soemthing inbetween. Furkigs are a more recent genre of masks that are becoming more popular. While the wiki does not currently have a page for furkigs, there are a number of makers who offer them.

It is worth mentioning, a lot of makers use one of a few rather generic shells for the masks, leading to many more budget offerings looking similar. Custom furkig makers often pride themselves on the quality of their masks and the attention to detail in comparison and will often be far more expensive.
