# Hadatai Basics

## Intro to Hadatai - Hadatai vs Zentai
Hadatai (ハダタイ) is a type of zentai-like bodysuit worn by kigs. Its not a zentai, but a hadatai.

Compared to a zentai, hadatai tend to be:

- Made to measure and tailored to the customer
- Matte flesh-toned finish
- Increased attention towards clean, smooth seams, particularly around the joints.
- Typically but not always, better quality materials

Zentai additionally tend to use a warmer, more beige flesh-toned color:

<div
  style={{width: "50px", height: "50px", backgroundColor: "#C69653", display: "inline-block"}}
></div>

Compared to the more pink-flesh standard kig masks and hadatai use:
MWF hadatai for instance uses Pantone® 7513 U:
<div
  style={{width: "50px", height: "50px", backgroundColor: "lab(78.99% 15.06 8.60)", display: "inline-block"}}
></div>
For comparison [kig.land](https://help.kig.land/MAICRA) claims to use Pantone® 7514 U: 
<div
  style={{width: "50px", height: "50px", backgroundColor: "lab(73.18% 16.01 13.39)", display: "inline-block"}}
></div>

Do note that these are just examples, colors may vary between makers, production batches, and the viewed color depends on your monitor being correctly calibrated.
What is consistent is the difficulty in finding a zentai that properly matches the typical kigurumi pinkish flesh tones.
Know a zentai maker that does? Please let us know over on our [github](https://github.com/kig-wiki/kigwiki/issues)


While a hadatai is not strictly required, it is a common and recommended addition to kigurumi mask to have the full costumed experience. That said, do not buy one simply because someone told you to, do your own research and make a decision that is right for you. A bad zentai can be far worse than no zentai.

:::warning

Velcro is a hadatai's worst enemy, and will pull at the material. There are some makers that offer fabrics less prone to this however the average hadatai is not one of them.

## Hadatai Alternatives

Some kigurumi alternatively opt to use latex bodysuits instead of a hadatai. Future information about latex bodysuits will be added in [latex info](/hadatai/latex-info)

As previously mentioned, some opt to use a zentai suit instead of a hadatai. Due to the generic sizing of a zentai, the mismatch of color compared to masks, and the general low quality of most zentai, this is not recommended.
