## Kigurumi costs and timelines

Point blank, kigurumi is not a cheap hobby.

Many masks are made to order, and as such can take months as a maker works through their backlog. Masks also arent cheap, expect to pay several hundred dollars, while kigurumi is ever-more accessible, it is not a hobby easy to enjoy on a budget.

### A note about budget

The cheapest mask makers usually cost cut corners, such as AI to replace human artists, and generally do a quick and dirty job of details such as paint, hair styling and so on. While higher cost does not mean better, this is not a hobby where cheaping out results in a quality experience.

Being real no one wants to be the kig that looks uncanny or like they went to Spirit Halloween. While some may perceive this as elitist, many kigs avoid interacting with people who rush to simply have the bare minimum to call themselves a kigurumi cosplayer in hopes it will grant them access to "the community". This is not the case, there is no one community, it is not a club.

Similarly to non-masked cosplay, many feel awkward when they have put in the effort to look their best and someone comes along treating it akin to just a joke or low effort gimmick.

Like many thing in life, friendships are based on mutual interests and respect, not simply sharing a surface level mutual interest in a hobby. Do not buy a kigurumi mask assuming it is buying you friends, it is not.

### DIY is not for everyone

tl;dr: DIY is not for everyone, it is a lot of work, requires a lot of time and proficiency in several skills in order to get half decent results. Most who DIY areless about saving money and more about getting every last detail exactly how they want.

The [cautionary DIY page](../DIY-mask/reality-of-diy.md) has more information on the reality of DIY kigurumi masks.
