    question: "Can Kigurumi talk?",
    answer: "Kigurumi masks aren't really made to be talked through, and owing to the mascot-like nature of kigurumi most kigs don't talk to stay in character.\n\nThere are some kigs that do, some might only speak when needed, few kigs deal in absolutes. Some romanticize not talking at all, safety is always most important."

  {
    question: "What exactly is Animegao?",
    answer: "Animegao is an old translation artifact dating back to early web translations of the term Kigurumi. Specifically, anime-style masks were confused to be a unique term for Kigurumi masks themselves. This is not the case; however, in the west it has become its own sub-genre of Kigurumi, embracing stylizations unique to western mask makers."
