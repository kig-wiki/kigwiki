description: Guide to Traveling With Kigurumi Masks, how to travel safely with your kig mask
---

Most kigs find some sort of padded box for transporting their kigurumi masks, or smaller bags like a motorcycle helmet bag for shorter trips. This area will be expanded to include various methods.

## Flying with Kig

Kigs usually try to go one of two routes.

Most if they can fit in a carry on will, some will use a motorcycle helmet bag, some will pad up their mask in regular luggage. Technically speaking a Pelican iM2275 is the largest you can fit under a plane seat, but only smaller 3/4 masks will fit.

If they can't fit it in a carry on, "Pelican" style boxes are a popular choice. The largest you can fly with on most airlines before going oversized is the [Nanuk 960](https://nanuk.com/products/nanuk-960)

Other considerations before flying should include:

- **Remove any batteries**: It should be obvious but if you have a mask with batteries for fans or light-up eyes, remove them.
- **Packing**: Packing securely and protected is a given, but consider not to pack any objects that might increase the odds airport staff might want to open your luggage. Silicone padding or other oddly dense objects can raise a flag.
- **Insurance**: Many airlines will not cover damage to your luggage or mask. Consider booking via a credit card that offers free travel insurance if you have one. Most still will not cover most of the mask's cost but may at least dampen the blow.
