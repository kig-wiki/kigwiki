# Kigurumi Storage Methods

Kigs usually store their mask either in a suitable box, or on tripod or wig stand with a large plastic bag overtop to keep dust off. 

Before storing its a good idea to brush and tidy the hair, rather than leaving it to be untangled before next wear. 
Regardless of storage, for longer hair using hair ties or scrunchies can help keep the hair tidy.

It may be obvious, but do not leave the mask in direct sunlight, in hot or humid areas, or in a spot easy to get knocked over. 

For longer term storage consider using a desiccant to help keep the mask dry, padding should be completely dry before.
