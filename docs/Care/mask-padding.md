# Kigurumi Mask Padding Guide 

Padding is a common way to customize a mask to best fit your head. While makers will do a best effort attempt, you will often have to customize the padding to best fit your head.


<div className="info-box-container">
  <img 
    src="/img/padding/microfiber-sponges.jpg" 
    alt="Microfiber Sponges"
    className="info-box-image"
    loading="lazy"
  />
  <div className="info-box-caption">
    Microfiber Sponges
  </div>
</div>

Some makers will use plain foam, consider using microfiber sponges with velcro strips as a removable, cleanable option. Some makers do use these, but it is not guaranteed. These sponges can often be found on amazon or other online retailers for cleaning or waxing cars.
