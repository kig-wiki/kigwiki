Pre-ramble that inspired the section:
Most kigs are not professional photographers, but many are interested in taking better photos of themselves and their friends.

Even if you are using a cellphone, theres lots of little things that can help regardless of what you're using:

- Better lighting, especially if you're indoors
- Remote camera shutter and a tripod, stand, or mount otherwise
- Lens cleaning tool

And similarly regardless of what you're using:

- Lighting theory
- Camera Angles
- Post Processing
- Optimizing your photos before uploading to social media

:::note

This section is under development. Future content plans to include:

- A whole lot more about Photography
- Deeper dive into more of the above topics
