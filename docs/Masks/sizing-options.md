Many makers will offer a range of sizing options, this is often based on the size of your head, but also the proportions you are trying to achieve.

A younger head shape will often be proportionally bigger to the rest of the body, so a larger head size may be more appropriate. Similar if your body is on the larger side, a larger head may be more appropriate to achieve a more balanced look. Opposite can also be true, too large a mask may look out of place, somewhat 'bobblehead like' on a smaller body.
