# Kigurumi Eyes

Kigurumi eyes are a key part of the mask, and one of the first things people will notice.


## Eyeports

Eyeports are the holes in the mask that allow you to see. Many will often do a crease in the brows, however many add additional visilibity through the eyes.

Sometimes this is done with disguised cutouts, sometimes with a mesh you can see through, some even opt to use glass lenses to see through. 
Regardless of the method, the goal is to allow you to see, and often in the case of cutouts and mesh, for the mask to breathe better too.

To be added: examples of each of the above as well as basic theory on how they get disguised.

## Eye Features

Some makers offer a range of eye features, such as 'follow-me-eyes'. Those are eyes with a concave design that appears to follow the movement of the viewer, they do rely on lens-type eyes and with some makers may be prone to fogging up as a result.
