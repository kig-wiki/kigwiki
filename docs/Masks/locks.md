# Locks

Some kigurumi are all about being locked in, literally. A lock is a feature that allows you to secure the mask to your head, although not all masks support this.

Typically 'full lock' masks will have a mechanism either with an integrated lock, or that allows a basic lock to be attached to secure the mask.
Just remember, please take care not to lose the key.

To be added: examples of masks with locks and those without.
