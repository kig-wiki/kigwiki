# Mask Padding and Fitting

Padding and fitting is a key part of the mask. Mask makers will do what they can to provide a comfortable fit, this often includes being able to adjust the padding to get the best fit.

You want padding that is comfortable, holds the mask at the right level in place, but is not too tight. The less space for air to flow around your head, the more likely it is to actually escape from the mask keeping you cool.

To be added: examples of padding and fitting and various makers that offer them.
