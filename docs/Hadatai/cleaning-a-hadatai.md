# Cleaning a Hadatai

Hadatai like any other garment can get dirty. Especially if you are wearing it out and about some areas like the hands can get quite discolored if you arent careful, although most stains are usually solveable. 

A little bit of maintenance after wearing it goes a long way to keeping it looking good as new.

## Summary

* Spot treat stains with ivory soap or a specialized stain remover
* Ideally handwash using a gentle detergent
* If you need to use a washing machine:
    * Use a gentle cycle, cold water
    * Do not mix with other clothes 
    * Put the hadatai in a mesh laundry bag
* Do not put in a clothes dryer, let it air dry
* Do not bleach or use fabric softener

## Stain Removal

If you get a stain on your hadatai, don't panic, it happens to the best of us. Do however keep in mind that the longer you wait to clean it, the more difficult it may be to remove.

Many kigurumi swear by a trusty bar of Ivory soap to remove stains, particularly around the hands and feet. Lightly dampen the area of the hadatai with water and rub the soap in as a pre-treatment.

Purpose-made stain removers are also available, with the advantage of being able to target specific stains and not just general purpose removers.

One such specialized product is the [Nanox for Stains on Collars and Sleeves](https://www.lion.co.jp/en/products/category/fabric/31#sec-83) although this product is not readily available in the west. 

If you are using a stain remover you haven't tried before, like with regular clothes before using it on a highly visible area try testing it on a small inconspicuous spot of the hadatai first, to ensure it doesn't discolor the fabric. A stain remover shouldnt, but it's always better to be sure.

## Washing

### Detergent

As described in the summary section, ideally you should handwash your hadatai using a gentle detergent. Woolite in the delicate, pink colored bottle is a popular choice, regardless of the brand you choose, use something gentle that is friendly to the fabric and your skin.

### Hand Washing

Hand washing is one of the best ways to care for your hadatai or other delicate garments. If this concept is new to you, honestly it's not that difficult, will preserve the fabric, and is a good skill to have. That said learning how to is better left to videos on youtube or tiktok.

Just remember, it's the rinsing that really gets dirt out, rinse well if not multiple times.

### Machine Washing

If you need to use a washing machine, use the most gentle cycle your machine has.
Use cold water, and not too much detergent.
Put the hadatai in a mesh laundry bag to protect the hadatai from getting snagged or caught on the washing machine.
Ideally wash the hadatai by itself but adding shapewear in their own mesh bags usually wont cause harm. The key point is dont mix with other colors, or with heavily stained items, dont give opportunity for stains to transfer.

## Drying

:::warning

Leave the hadatai to air dry, do not put it in a clothes dryer.

:::

Ideally hang it up to dry in a spot with good air circulation, even a decent clothes hanger can do just avoid pulling the fabric. Ideally a proper drying rack of some kind is best, google has plenty of diy ideas if you dont have anything suitable.
