Hadatai (ハダタイ) is a type of zentai-like bodysuit worn by kigs. Its not a zentai, but a hadatai.

Compared to a zentai hadatai tend to be:

- Made to measure and tailored to the customer
- Matte flesh-toned finish
- Specific attention to various seems particularly around the joints

Zentai additionally tend to use an orange-ish, warmer flesh-toned color, compared to an example of a pink-ish, cooler flesh tone used by masks or hadatai:

<div
  style={{width: "50px", height: "50px", backgroundColor: "#C69653", display: "inline-block"}}
></div>

<div
  style={{width: "50px", height: "50px", backgroundColor: "#F0D0BB", display: "inline-block"}}
></div>

Do note that these are just examples, exact colors greatly vary between makers.

While a hadatai is not strictly required, it is a common and recommended addition to kigurumi mask to have the full costumed experience. That said, do not buy one simply because someone told you to, do your own research and make a decision that is right for you. A bad zentai can be far worse than no zentai.
