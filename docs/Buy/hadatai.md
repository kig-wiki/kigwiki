## Ordering Tips

- **Hadatai are made to measure**: As hadatai are custom made for each customer, the measurements are typically not a one size fits all. Some makers like GKO have various generic sizes available.
- **Orders take time**: As hadatai are custom made for each customer the production time typically takes a while regardless of maker. Do not expect to receive your hadatai in a week.
- **Taobao Agents**: Many hadatai makers are on Taobao and require using an agent for international orders. We are working on a [taobao guide](./taobao-guide.md) to help with this.
- **Measurements**: Ask the hadatai maker for their measurements guide, it is highly, *highly* recommended to have someone help measure you to ensure it fits correctly. Typically these measurements are best done with any padding or shapewear being used.
- **Material**: Consider the material thickness (1mm, 2mm, etc.) based on your needs. Thicker material obscure lines and anything under the hadatai, while thinner material run cooler and are more breathable.
