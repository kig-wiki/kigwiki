# Commissioning a Mask

While each maker's process varies, typically you will need to provide the following:

- Reference art
- Head size

## Reference Art

Reference art is typically the most important part of the commissioning process, it does not have to be perfect, nor a single image, but it should be a good representation of the character you are trying to portray.

Consider highlighting what youv consider the most important details. 
Maybe it's the way certain hair is styled, or the way certain accessories are worn. The way their eyes should look, what kind of mouth expression they have, and so on.

Commissioning an artist to create custom reference art is a great way to have exactly the representation you want, alhough it's not purely necessary. 

## Head Size and Proportions

Many makers have varying levels of head sizes they can accomidate, when comissioning however it may also be a good idea to ask how large they can make the mask relative to your head size. A larger mask is often a good idea for characters with smaller proportions, especially the taller or larger the kigurumi performer is. Its all about proportions and finding the right balance.

## Other Considerations

- Maker's pricing
- Maker's timeline
