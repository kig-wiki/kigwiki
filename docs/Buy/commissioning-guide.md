# Kigurumi Mask Commissioning Guide

If you are looking for a list of kigurumi mask makers, check out our [Kigurumi Maker List](./makers.md).

While each maker's process varies, typically you will need to provide two key pieces of information to a maker:

- Reference art
- Head size

## Reference Art

Reference art is typically the most important part of the commissioning process, it does not have to be perfect, nor a single image, but it should be a good representation of the character you are trying to portray.

Consider highlighting what youv consider the most important details. 
Maybe it's the way certain hair is styled, or the way certain accessories are worn. The way their eyes should look, what kind of mouth expression they have, and so on.

Commissioning an artist to create custom reference art is a great way to have exactly the representation you want, alhough it's not purely necessary. 

## Head Size and Proportions

Many makers have varying levels of head sizes they can accomidate, when comissioning however it may also be a good idea to ask how large they can make the mask relative to your head size. A larger mask is often a good idea for characters with smaller proportions, especially the taller or larger the kigurumi performer is. Its all about proportions and finding the right balance.

## Considerations and Questions to Ask When Commissioning a Kigurumi Mask

### Maker's pricing

Perhaps an obvious question, pricing varies greatly even between masks done by a single maker. Complexities in hair design, accessories if any, or additional features and more will typically cost more. Some makers for example may charge more if you are asking for a larger sized mask then their average size. 

An example of a hair style that would typically cost more are ones with many different colors, or heavily styled wigs. Precure characcters for instance often have rather challenging hair styles.

### Maker's timeline

Makers often can have both a backlog and a general timeline for how long a mask will take to make. For example, a maker might start working on the mask itself in three months, and then have it done within two months. Makers often are a number of experts working on various parts of the mask, collectively working on many masks, be aware its rarely a single person working on a single mask.
