# Taobao Guide for Buying Kigurumi Masks and Hadatai

Many makers of masks, hadatai, cosplay and outfits are located on Taobao, a Chinese ecommerce platform. Learning to buy off taobao may seem a bit daunting, but greatly expands the options you have while also being able to buy cheaper than through some reseller.

## Proxy Services/Taobao Agents

Most often you will have to use a proxy service to buy from Taobao. Proxy services are a service that will forward your order to Taobao and then ship it to you. While there is an added cost, its typically far cheaper than buying from resellers such as on Aliexpress or other similar platforms.

### Agents

Some commonly used agents are:

- [Superbuy](https://www.superbuy.com/)
- [Sugargoo](https://sugargoo.com/)
