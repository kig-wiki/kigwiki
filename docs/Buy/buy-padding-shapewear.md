# Where to Buy Padding and Shapewear for Kigurumi

TLDR: Padding isnt exclusive to kigurumi, people usually buy off the shelf shapewear and padding. Many of these sellers market primarily towards crossdressers, trans people, or various gender-bending performers.

:::warning

Due to the nature of padding and shapewear, some of the sites below **will** contain content some may find NSFW, for instance, breast forms.

:::

The following sites are listed in no particular order.

## Padding

### Roanyer

Roanyer has a wide variety of silicone padding on [their own website](https://www.roanyer.com/) and also a [Tmall store](https://roanyer.world.tmall.com/shop/view_shop.htm), the latter of which Western buyers will need to use a proxy service to order from. They carry a wide range of padding, including silicone, foam, and latex.

[Hip pads](https://www.roanyer.com/large-silicone-hip-padss) for instance are a popular item, even among women who kig to achieve a more anime styled proportion. 

### Moli's / InThemask

[Moli's](https://inthemask.com/) is another seller of various silicone padding, along with various "fem mask" related items. 

An example of their silicone hip padding [can be found here](https://inthemask.com/products/the-super-pads-by-luxentra)

### Countless resellers on Amazon, Aliexpress, and Taobao

Honestly for basic foam padding, you can find a lot of resellers on Amazon, Aliexpress, and Taobao. They are usually cheap and come in a variety of sizes. YMMV on quality and durability, but compared to silicone padding it's a lot more accessible of an entrypoint.

## Shapewear

### Maidenform

Primarily marketed towards women, [Maidenform](https://www.maidenform.com/shapewear) has a wide variety of shapewear primarily focused on slimming the stomach and waist. Not as form compressing as a corset however still very effective for many. Many of their products are available at Amazon and other major retailers making them a decently reliable source. 

### Other sellers on Amazon, Aliexpress, and Taobao

Akin to the mention above on padding, you can find a lot of shapewear on Amazon, Aliexpress, and Taobao. They are usually cheap and come in a variety of sizes. YMMV on quality and durability, we plan to add a more comprehensive list of shapewear sellers in the future.
