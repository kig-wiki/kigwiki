# Kigurumi Mask Sizing Options


Many makers will offer a range of sizing options, this is often based on the size of your actual head, but also the proportions you are trying to achieve.

A younger character or chibi style character will typically have a larger head shape compared to the rest of the body, so a larger mask size is often more appropriate. Similar if your body is on the larger side, a larger mask size may be more appropriate to achieve a more balanced look, its all about proportion play and working with what you have.

Opposite can also be true, too large a mask may look out of place, somewhat 'bobblehead like' on a smaller body.

## Maker Sizing Options

Most makers these days use 3D printed masks, which allow them to highly customize the mask to the customer's specifications. These makers often can offer a wide variety of sizes.

Makers that do semi-custom or "generic" masks, or who are still using traditional mold making will typically have a much more limited range of sizes available. Sigma and GKO are two such makers whose main offerings are limited to a few sizes. Custom options are usually available but at a higher cost, longer wait, and other limitations. This doesnt mean they are a bad or limited maker by any means, its just a matter of what they offer and what you are looking for.
