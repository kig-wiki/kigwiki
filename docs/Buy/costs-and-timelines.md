# Kigurumi Mask Ordering Costs & Timelines

TLDR: Many masks are made to order, and as such can take a while to make. Some months, many have backlogs, patience is a virtue.  Masks also arent cheap, expect to pay several hundred dollars for a good quality custom mask.

Unfortunately many scam sellers prey on wanting a mask quickly, in a "buy now get right away" mindset. For better or worse, Kigurumi mask makers very rarely operate on a premade basis as they are not mass produced or one-size-fits-all.
