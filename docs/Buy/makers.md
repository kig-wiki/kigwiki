## Maker Styles

Makers will often have signature styles that they are known for, and this can be seen in the masks they make. Sigma for instance is known for more of a vintage aesthetic compared to today's more moeblob anime designs. 

Many makers can cover a range of styles, but if you have a specific style in mind, it's worth looking into a maker that is known for that style or has produced similar styles in the past.

## Ordering Tips

- **Status**: Check the maker's current wait times before ordering
- **Custom Work**: Full custom masks typically cost more and take longer than semi-custom options
