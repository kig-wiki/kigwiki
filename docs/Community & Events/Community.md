# Kigurumi Communities

Kigurumi draws fans from all background, and open spaces such as social media or groupchats can draw especially colorful personalities. However, they do not represent every kigurumi nor kigurumi fan. Try not to let an off encounter shape your view. The broader community is wide-ranging, welcoming, and rich with unique approaches to the hobby.

What this section will _not_ cover is advertising communities nor trying to make this resource into
a community either. This is a resource for the community, not a community itself.

## "The Kigurumi Community"

Unfortunately a number of potential kigurumi assume buying a mask will open doors to "the community". Kigurumi however is made up of many different communities, individual performers, small groups, and yes, a few larger ones.
While engaging in the hobby can lead to meeting others with similar interests, it does not guarantee entry into any particular community. 

And much as Kigurumi performing is often mute, you have to have good communication skills if you want to network in the communities. You also have to be willing to put in the work to actually network, not just expect it to happen magically.
