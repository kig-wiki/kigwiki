# Before you consider doing a DIY Kigurumi Mask

Often times on social media, the realities of making a DIY Kigurumi Mask are not fully portrayed, often only showing the highlights and the the tedius process. This page is meant to provide a more realistic view of the realities of making a DIY Kigurumi Mask.

A quick fact check:

**DIY is not easy**: DIY Kigurumi masks take proficiency in a number of skills including but not limited to: 
- 3D modeling
- 3D Printing
- Sanding 
- Airbrush painting 
- Wig making and styling

If you are new to 3d printing cosplay props, have never styled a wig, or have never seen a kigurumi mask up close before, DIY will introduce a number of new challenges and learning curves.

While some components can be outsourced, such as using a generic premade model, or leveraging a 3d printing service, there is a lot of work that needs to be done in order to get a mask to a point where it is ready to be used.

Regular wigs for instance are not nearly big enough for Kig masks for instance and **will** look uncanny if used, you will often need to piece together the wig yourself. Masks need styling as well, if you arent used to styling wigs, you will want to learn and use practice wigs before attempting to style a mask's hair.

**Just because your friend has a 3D printer, doesnt mean it's suitable for your needs**: Kig masks are large, prone to warping, and themselves are a rather challenging prop to print. FDM printers take forever to print them at any reasonable quality, there is good reason why most makers use SLA printers and rather outsource to print farms.

You probably also want to be printing in something more heat resistant, but more difficult to print than PLA, such as ABS/ASA.

**DIY often doesnt save you money or time**: DIY Kigurumi masks are not a quick or cheap endeavor.

Iteration is a key part of the DIY process, and often times you will need to iterate on a design or a mask before you get it to a point where you are happy with it. Just because a 3d model might work for one person, does not mean it will work for you.

**There are subltle nuances to mask making that are often overlooked**:
Details such as getting the eyes holes aligned properly to see through while also being able to see out of the eyes are often overlooked, and can be a pain to get right. Expressions are often a combination of stylization in both the mask's shape itself and the painting, there are subtle tricks makers use to achieve various expressions.

Do not expect the first mask shell you get printed to be the one that you want to use, its not unusual to have to iterate multiple times before it's suitable.

One of the best things you can do is study other people's masks, although finer details are often difficult to notice from social media photos alone. 

**Safety equipment is often overlooked**: 

Safety equipment is also sadly often overlooked, do not skip on a resperator when sanding or painting, no kig mask is worth your health. There have been makers who have had major health issues due to not wearing a resperator.
