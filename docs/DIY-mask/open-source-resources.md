# Open-Source Resources for DIY Kigurumi Masks

If you are still determined to DIY your own kigurumi mask, there are a number of open source resources that can help you. Do note while these models are free to download, many are often made available for personal use only, as in not to be made to be sold for commercial use.

## 3D Models

There exist a few open source 3d models that can be used as a starting point for your own mask.

### plumKigurumi

One such model to be used with Blender is [plumKigurumi](https://github.com/vuicoo/plumKigurumi-) by [鹊跃](https://x.com/i/status/1741975998399439042). 

### Kiglover

Kiglover is a maker who has released models for personal use, and who also have a number of tutorials on their website, [kiglover.com](https://kiglover.com/). Their models can also be found on thingiverse [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/Kiglover/designs).

Their socials are also worth checking out for more information and inspiration.

If DIY is a bit too much, you can also consider commissioning Kiglover to make a mask for you.

### Other Models

Sites such as [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=kigurumi&page=1P) in general also have a number of models available for download, and can be also worth checking out for inspiration, accessories, and other parts. [Yeggi](https://www.yeggi.com/) is a search aggregator for 3d models as well that also can be worth checking out.
