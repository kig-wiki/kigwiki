# Eyes

Kigurumi's eyes are their gateway to the world. Not just one the fist places people will look, but also one of the important parts for you to be able to look at the world.


## Eyeports

Eyeports are the holes in the mask that allow you to see. Referencing the [kigurumi eyes](/masks/kigurumi-eyes) section for more information.

To be added: examples of actually making the various types of eyeports.

## Eye Design

To be added: links to various anime eye design reference guides


A reference some may find useful to experiment around with is [vroid studio](https://vroid.com/studio), a free to use 3d avatar creator on Steam and the app store. It's not a perfect tool, but has quite a few options and features for playing around with and exporting eye designs.
