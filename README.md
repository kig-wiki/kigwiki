# What is Kigurumi?

Bishoujo Kigurumi, Kigurumi (着ぐるみ), or Kig/Kigu for even shorter is a mask oriented form of cosplay. Kigurumi typically combines both an anime styled mask with a type of zentai worn underneath, a Hadatai or Hada for short. Through strategic shapewear and padding wearers seek to transform themselves into their ideal of the represented character.

# What this aims to be

- A community resource that no one person owns, that is free as in freedom not free as in free beer. Libre, not gratis
- A site that provides those interested in Kigurumi with a spectrum of knowledge so they may best be equiped to make decisions

# What this is _not_ meant to be

- A community
- Any one individual's soapbox, the more contributors there are the further we can strive towards this
- An advertising spot for makers, merchants, etc
- A copy/paste of other kigurumi resources

# Why kig.wiki exists

tldr: inactivity and out of date info on various kigurumi resources, biases on many of said resources, or otherwise painting of various matters as black and white. Kigurumi is a bespoke hobby made by artesians both commercial and DIY, it is not a mass produced factory good, quality is not such a binary matter. Much like you would consider certain artists for certain art commisions based on their unique style, there is nuance to why you may want to go with one maker or the other as per the vision you have of your kigurumi. There rarely are perfect answers, only informed or uninformed decisions.

Docusaurus is MIT licensed, as is any applicable content of the kig.wiki site. Fork it or do as you please, like Kigurumi is for everyone so is this github's content.

The Master branch of this repo is used in CI to build upon PR and auto update the website itself. What you see here should be what the website is actively displaying.

# Isnt this called Animegao?

[As denoted on the Japanese Kigurumi wikipedia page](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BE%8E%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3%E7%9D%80%E3%81%90%E3%82%8B%E3%81%BF), the term originates from certain western demographics. While some western audiences may use the term, this resource does not wish to be a proponent of the misinterpretation stemmed amalgamation of a term, let it's usage be as antiquated and culturally incongruent as Japanimation. Usage of the term may be confusing to international audiences.
